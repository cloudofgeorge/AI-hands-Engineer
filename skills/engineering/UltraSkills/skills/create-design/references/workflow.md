# Create-Design Workflow

Use this file when creating, rewriting, reviewing, or materially restructuring a project's design-memory system.

Create Design is `Frontend-Taste` acting as design architect for repo design memory. It creates or edits design law, not frontend implementation.

This workflow is approval-gated even for review-only passes.
If the target mode or scope is still fuzzy, route first-pass discovery through `grill-me`, then come back here.

## Stage map

1. `source-audit`
2. `Frontend-Taste proposer` / `proposal`
3. `visual-direction calibration` when creating or repairing design law without a chosen direction
4. `implement`
5. `Frontend-Taste attacker` / `critic/fix loop`
6. `post-implement review`

Not every task needs the full weight, but the stage boundaries should stay intact. The proposer and attacker are separate `Frontend-Taste` passes; do not let the drafter self-approve.

## Frontend-Taste role split

Use `../../roles/frontend-taste/ROLE.md` and `../../roles/frontend-taste/RUBRIC.md` directly, then follow the loaded role files for any additional design-memory or learning references. Apply the role in two distinct passes:

- `Frontend-Taste proposer/design architect`: closes the workflow-specific design-memory context, chooses the product-tied direction, and drafts or edits `DESIGN.md` using the loaded Frontend-Taste role material.
- `Frontend-Taste attacker/critic`: attacks the proposed design-memory artifact against the approved context and loaded Frontend-Taste role material before implementation is considered done.

The proposer must close, or explicitly mark unanswered, these questions before drafting:

- product type or mixed modes
- audience, including whether it is public, private, internal, invite-only, regulated, expert, or casual
- key action or reading path
- requirements, constraints, and non-goals
- trust posture, density, and emotional tone
- brand assets, screenshots, product context, competitors, and references
- visually critical states: loading, empty, error, success, permission, onboarding, long-content, and degraded-data states

`DESIGN.md` remains the operational design law and source of truth. References support the law; they do not replace it.

When either Frontend-Taste pass is delegated to a worker/subagent, role label alone is not enough. The parent prompt must include the shared delegated role task template from [../../../shared/delegate/delegated-role-task-template.md](../../../shared/delegate/delegated-role-task-template.md), filled for the selected role and task, plus the selected role material path, this workflow's proposer-or-attacker assignment, and the concrete design-memory scope. Do not paste Frontend-Taste doctrine into the parent prompt; taste doctrine stays in `../../roles/frontend-taste/ROLE.md`, `../../roles/frontend-taste/RUBRIC.md`, and role-internal references loaded by the worker. Do not accept the pass for a required gate when required material cannot be loaded or final-answer requirements cannot be satisfied.

## 0. Pick the mode

Choose one of these explicitly:

- `review`
  - existing design-memory review only
  - no file edits
  - output findings and recommended changes

- `proposal`
  - shape the intended design-memory plan
  - may inspect and plan, but does not edit files
  - stops for approval before edits

- `implement`
  - create or revise the design-memory files
  - declare whether the implementation is `create` or `edit`
  - includes critic/fix loop
  - must end with post-implementation review before completion

If the task started as `review` and now wants edits, stop and get explicit approval for the write phase.

## 1. Approval gate

Before any substantive work:
- confirm the mode
- confirm the target design-memory surface
- wait for explicit `APPROVED` or `LGTM`

Do not start:
- review findings generation
- restructuring execution
- file drafting
- fix loops
- review loops
before that approval.

Allowed before approval:
- one blocking clarification at a time
- read-only repo/source inspection when needed to understand scope, choose mode, or identify the current artifact shape
- narrowing whether the task is `review`, `proposal`, or `implement`

Not allowed before approval:
- full synthesized review findings
- full proposal output
- file drafting or edits

## 2. Source-audit stage

Start from concrete examples, not abstract design philosophy.

Inspect:
- the brief or request
- `../../roles/frontend-taste/ROLE.md` and `../../roles/frontend-taste/RUBRIC.md`, then any additional role files discovered from the loaded role files
- the product/surface type
- the current `DESIGN.md`, if present
- supporting design docs, if present
- refs only when they materially inform the direction
- repo context and constraints

Before any reference round or durable design-law draft, capture the product basis explicitly:
- product type
- audience, including whether it is closed/internal or public
- key surfaces
- primary read/action
- trust posture
- tone
- density expectation
- interaction model
- platform constraints
- constraints
- hard-nos
- content provenance
- what must not be touched

If those answers are missing, do not invent a full `DESIGN.md` from vibes. Ask the smallest blocking question set or mark the unknowns as unresolved proposal inputs.

Default review outputs:
- representative asks
- current or intended mode
- success criteria candidates
- artifact shape candidates
- risks / ambiguity
- recommendation: stop at review, continue to proposal, or continue to implementation planning

## Branch handling

Use this matrix to close the main workflow branches explicitly:

- `review` -> findings only -> stop unless the user separately approves proposal or implementation
- `proposal` -> plan only -> stop for write approval before any edits
- `implement/create` -> create a new design-memory system -> critic/fix -> post-implement review
- `implement/edit` -> revise an existing design-memory system -> critic/fix -> post-implement review
- mode change midstream -> stop and get the correct approval before continuing
- tiny wording or contract-only fix -> may compress ceremony, but still declare the mode and keep the same approval semantics
- refs justified -> only when they remove ambiguity or materially improve direction
- refs not justified -> keep the workflow doc-only
- `implement/create` or design-law repair without an explicit chosen visual direction -> run the reference refinement loop before writing canonical `DESIGN.md`
- existing `DESIGN.md` lightweight screen review or Frontend-Taste role work -> do not run the create-design reference loop unless the design-law artifact itself is being created or repaired

## 3. Proposal stage

Run `Frontend-Taste` as the proposer/design architect. Turn the audited material into a concrete design-memory shape.

Before drafting, close the base design-context questions or mark exactly what is unanswered.

Decide:
- target folder/file shape
- what belongs in `DESIGN.md`
- what belongs in supporting docs
- whether refs are actually justified
- if a reference/direction loop is justified, use exactly 3 references/options per round; do not import Frontend-Taste's 3-4 visual-proposal count into create-design
- what the critical branch closures are
- what the success criteria are

Minimum proposal checks:
- `DESIGN.md` can stay operational rather than bloated
- supporting docs are justified rather than ceremonial
- claimed output matches what the skill will actually produce
- downstream usage is clear enough for later review or implementation

After proposal:
- if edits are required, stop and wait for explicit approval before implementation
- do not smuggle implementation through the proposal stage

## 3A. Visual-direction reference refinement loop

Run this loop before canonical `DESIGN.md` creation or repair when the design direction is not already chosen.
The goal is calibration, not copying references. Do not write or update `DESIGN.md` from taste guesses.

Chosen visual direction minimum bar:
- A direction is explicit enough to bypass the loop only when palette, typography, layout model, density, shape/radius language, motion/interaction tone, and hard-no items are each either specified or explicitly accepted as gaps.
- Vague taste labels are not enough. `premium dark launcher`, `clean SaaS`, or `Apple-like but cooler` still trigger the loop unless those axes are covered.
- If an axis is an accepted gap, name how it will be handled later; do not silently fill it with agent taste.

Applicability:
- required for `implement/create` when the brief does not already contain an explicit visual direction
- required for design-law repair when the current direction is incoherent, absent, or based on unstated taste
- not for lightweight Frontend-Taste screen review inside an existing `DESIGN.md`
- not for routine implementation review where the canonical design law already exists and is stable

Reference round rules:
- one round contains exactly 3 references/directions/options
- the 3 options must be meaningfully different, not near-duplicates
- vary at least 2-3 relevant axes per round: layout model, palette direction, density, typography character, shape/radius language, interaction/motion tone, emotional tone
- include multiple palette hypotheses appropriate to the product basis; never present one self-selected palette as the only path
- do not copy references; extract direction constraints and tradeoffs
- do not present one nice option and canonize it

Required per-option shape:
- distinct thesis: what this option believes the product should feel like
- palette hypothesis: primary dark/light/color role direction, not final tokens
- layout model: navigation, composition, hierarchy, and information grouping idea
- axes: type character, density, shape/radius, and motion/interaction tone
- borrow: constraints, relationships, or mechanics worth adopting
- do-not-copy: visual signatures, brand markers, or ornamental details that must stay out

Reference synthesis, not copying:
- Good: borrow `tight command-center density + restrained amber status accents`; reject the source brand's logo geometry and exact gradients.
- Bad: recreate the reference's hero, icon style, palette, and spacing because it looked premium.

Decision point after each round:
- Sergey may pick one option
- Sergey may mix parts of multiple options
- Sergey may reject all options
- Sergey may ask to continue with another round

Direction approval boundary:
- Choosing, combining, or narrowing options approves design direction only.
- It does not approve file edits unless the active mode is already approved `implement`.
- If the workflow was still in `review` or `proposal`, stop after direction synthesis and get explicit write approval before creating or updating files.

After every feedback point, record:
- what was liked
- what was rejected
- direction constraints
- hard-no items

Iteration limits:
- maximum 3 rounds
- each next round must reflect prior feedback
- do not replay the same variants with cosmetic changes
- if 3 rounds are exhausted, stop and require an explicit decision; do not auto-synthesize

Before writing or updating canonical `DESIGN.md`, produce a direction synthesis covering:
- chosen direction
- rejected directions
- palette direction, or explicit accepted gap
- typography direction, or explicit accepted gap
- layout direction, or explicit accepted gap
- density, or explicit accepted gap
- shape/radius, or explicit accepted gap
- motion, or explicit accepted gap
- critical hard-no items, or explicit accepted gap
- open risks

Only after that synthesis may create-design write or update canonical `DESIGN.md`.

## 4. Implement stage

If the visual-direction reference refinement loop applies, enter implementation only after Sergey has chosen, mixed, or explicitly decided a direction and the synthesis exists. No canonical `DESIGN.md` before that gate. Direction choice alone is not write approval; it only satisfies the visual-direction gate.

Run `Frontend-Taste` as the proposer/design architect for the approved write phase. Build the smallest useful design-memory structure:
- `DESIGN.md` for the main design law and artifact routing
- supporting docs only when they remove real ambiguity or bloat

Implementation rules:
- keep `DESIGN.md` lean enough to navigate
- do not write design law from a single self-selected palette, near-duplicate options, or unapproved reference guesses
- keep rules operational rather than atmospheric-only
- do not promise artifacts that do not exist
- do not let refs replace doctrine
- if the design needs multiple docs, make their boundaries explicit

## 5. Critic/fix loop

After the first draft, run a structured review/fix loop. The required adversarial pass is a separate `Frontend-Taste` attacker/critic, not the same proposer re-reading its own work.

Default loop:
1. draft or revise
2. critic review
3. fix
4. critic review
5. fix again if needed

Run a third review/fix round when:
- `DESIGN.md` is still bloated
- artifact boundaries are still fuzzy
- rules are still vague or contradictory
- downstream usage is still unclear

Attacker workflow focus:
- product/audience/constraint fit and unresolved-context honesty
- `DESIGN.md` source-of-truth priority and artifact boundary coherence
- approved direction/ref synthesis fidelity without copying or vibe-fill
- operational value for downstream readers

All visual-quality and taste criteria come from the loaded Frontend-Taste role material, not from an inlined parent prompt rule wall.

## 6. Post-implementation review

Do not stop at “edits done”.

Review the implemented result against the approved proposal and the `Frontend-Taste` attacker findings:
- did it change the right thing?
- did it change it the right way?
- does it match the approved scope?
- can a downstream reader use `DESIGN.md` without guessing?
- are supporting docs justified and linked clearly?
- did any branch remain only conceptually described instead of operationally closed?

For non-trivial rewrites, treat this as a real gate, not a courtesy lap.

## 7. Late-stage compression

After the main draft/review/fix loop is clean, run one compression pass through `forthright` for AI-only design-memory material when that removes wording fat without weakening trigger boundaries, artifact rules, or safety constraints.

Then do one final sanity review.

## 8. Testing

Validate with representative prompts.

Check:
- intended asks trigger correctly
- create/repair asks without an explicit chosen direction trigger the 3-option reference loop and direction synthesis before `DESIGN.md`
- existing-`DESIGN.md` lightweight role work does not over-trigger the create-design reference loop
- paraphrases still trigger
- adjacent prompts do not over-trigger
- the workflow stays honest when mode or scope changes
- supporting docs are justified rather than ceremonial
- `DESIGN.md` remains operational
- trigger quality and false-positive rate were reviewed explicitly

## 9. Finalize

Stop only when:
- the approved mode was completed cleanly
- any required write phase had explicit approval
- post-implementation review is clean enough
- the skill folder is internally consistent
- referenced files actually exist
- claimed capabilities match the shipped shape
