# Orbita Architecture

## Scope

This document is the architecture contract for the Orbita workflow-runner
runtime. It records layer ownership, dependency direction, retired surfaces,
conditional helper/schema zones, shard/fanout control steps, and review gates.

This contract covers `skills/orbita/**`. It does not define the dashboard visual
design; that remains in `DESIGN.md`.

## Supported Runtime Surface

The canonical workflow-runner command surface is:

- `next`
- `instructions`
- `write-output`
- `continue`
- API `listPointerTransitions` / CLI `list-pointer-transitions`
- API `movePointer` / CLI `move-pointer`

Validation and persistence behavior that supports these commands belongs to the
current runtime architecture. Orchestrator debug notes and worker binding are
bounded `continue` side effects; they do not navigate separately and do not
accept worker output. Obsolete backward-compatibility surfaces do not.

`instructions --step-id` dispatches from the current effective host action,
not from a prompt cached on an executable step. A current `run_worker` request
returns Template-compiled worker instructions. A current
`wait_for_approval` request returns the same dedicated approval projection used
by `next` and `continue`. A request superseded by an unresolved non-blocking
stop, a terminal response, or a missing/stale current request has no loadable
step instructions and must fail before lease renewal.

`listPointerTransitions` and `movePointer` are runner API control-plane recovery
surfaces for repositioning only the current baton pointer among state-bearing
workflow predecessors. Their shell-facing CLI modes are `list-pointer-transitions` and
`move-pointer`. Both require an active run lease. `listPointerTransitions` is a
logical read: it may use the run-state boundary for consistency, but it must not
initialize missing run state, append history, renew authority, or mutate the
baton/current pointer. It is not an unleased public read because it exposes
bounded pointer recovery metadata. `movePointer` mutates only
baton cursor/status through the existing lease, lock, validation, durable writer,
history, and per-run authority path. Neither surface rolls back, prunes, rewrites, or cleans
`baton.state`, accepted outputs, artifacts/results, worker bindings, prompt
markers, attempts, or existing history. A move may target any state-bearing
predecessor that reaches the current cursor through transitions resolved from
the current workflow and baton state; it must never offer a downstream or
state-less workflow step. Terminal
single-cursor positions, including a completed `done` run, may move backward to
a state-bearing non-terminal predecessor; terminal status must not by itself make pointer
recovery unsupported. Array cursors are rejected by the baton schema and cannot
enter pointer recovery.
Pointer moves preserve baton state without an extra acknowledgement gate.

Retired surfaces:

- `start-run`
- `persist-run-state`
- `workflow-interpreter`
- legacy command aliases
- compatibility wrappers whose only purpose is preserving obsolete paths

Retired surfaces must not remain in supported command paths, exports, docs, or
boundary-check allow lists.

## Custom Workflow Catalog

Custom workflow support is a runtime catalog feature for existing workflow
documents, not a plugin marketplace, visual editor, or autonomous workflow
rewriter. Built-in workflows remain the first-party root. User-provided
workflows are discovered from an Orbita TOML config at `~/.orbita/orbita.toml`
or `ORBITA_CONFIG`.

The supported config shape is:

```toml
[workflow_catalog]

[[workflow_catalog.roots]]
source_id = "team"
path = "~/orbita-workflows"
```

Many configured roots are allowed. They stack after the built-in root in config
order. `source_id` values are stable catalog identities and must not use reserved
ids such as `built-in` or `override`.

Catalog identity is source/path-qualified:

- `workflowRef = <sourceId>:<relativeWorkflowPath>`
- workflow `name` is display and fuzzy-routing metadata
- duplicate names are ambiguous unless an exact `workflowRef` is provided

`workflow-catalog --workflows-root <dir>` remains an isolated compatibility
override. It does not merge with built-ins or configured roots and uses the
reserved `override` source id.

Startup validation is non-bypassable for newly initialized runs. `workflow-runs
create` validates the selected workflow before writing a run-index entry, and
`workflow-runner next` validates before creating a missing lease/index/baton.
Runtime continuation must use the persisted absolute workflow path and must not
rediscover catalog/config roots.

Workflow resource loading is source-aware and bounded to the workflow package
root unless the workflow is built-in and explicitly allowed to use repository
role/template/shared material. Custom workflow names must not widen resource
access by basename.

Workflow-authoring/autotrain is an upstream producer only. Authored packages
become runtime-visible only after human-reviewed promotion into a configured
root or an explicit `--workflows-root` override. Runtime list/resolve/run code
must not import authoring/autotrain internals, scan staging locations, or promote
generated workflows implicitly.

## Layer Ownership

### Entrypoints

Owner: `lib/entrypoints/**`

Entrypoints are transport shells. They parse CLI/API input, coordinate IO with
persistence adapters, acquire or pass through leases where needed, call named
use-case APIs, and format public output.

Pointer recovery entrypoints must keep API and CLI behavior aligned: both
`listPointerTransitions` and `movePointer` require active lease authority, return
only bounded DTOs/errors, and redact lease tokens, token hashes, raw private
paths, raw baton dumps, and full private history text.

Entrypoints may depend on:

- named use-case APIs
- persistence adapters
- DTOs, request/response records, and transport-local schemas

Entrypoints must not depend on:

- `lib/use-cases/runtime/**` internals for stable behavior
- sibling entrypoint shells, including CLI-to-API imports
- entity internals except through approved use-case or DTO boundaries

### Use Cases

Owner: `lib/use-cases/**`

Use cases own application flow over DTOs and plain values. They call entity
owners and IO-free runtime helpers, then return DTOs, projections, or command
results to entrypoints.

Top-level use cases must not import other top-level use cases as a stable
pattern. Shared application policy belongs in a colocated helper or an internal
use-case helper zone only when multiple use cases need the same policy.

`ContinueRun -> ApplyWorkflowOutput` was migrated into an internal workflow-output
helper. Recurrence of top-level use-case-to-use-case imports must fail boundary
checks instead of becoming a stable pattern.

### Entities

Owner: `lib/entities/**`

Entities own workflow-domain invariants and behavior for concepts such as
Workflow, Step, Template, and Baton. Entities are IO-free and owner-isolated.

Entities must not import:

- persistence
- entrypoints
- filesystem/path APIs
- unrelated entity owner internals

`entities/Baton` owns Baton behavior. A durable Baton schema shared by multiple
layers is a file contract, not an entity behavior dependency for persistence.

### Runtime Helpers

Owner: `lib/use-cases/runtime/**` and `lib/runtime/**`

Runtime helpers are deterministic and IO-free. They operate over supplied
values, entities, DTOs, and supplied schema/path facts.

Executable-step records are neutral: they identify the normal step action and
execution context but do not carry `compiledPrompt` or any other rendered text.
One host-work projection combines each executable record with runner control
state to select the effective host action before rendering. An unresolved stop
for that request projects `resolve_non_blocking_stop`; otherwise the normal
`run_worker`, `wait_for_approval`, or terminal path remains effective.

Template owns worker instructions and is reachable only from the effective
`run_worker` branch. A colocated approval contract/projection owner selects a
producer-authored summary, ordered safe artifact metadata, and an optional
route-applicable current verdict, then renders the bounded human gate. Stop and
terminal projections remain separate from both Template and approval
selection. Removing either the host-work projection or approval owner would
duplicate effective-action selection or the closed approval contract across
`next`, `continue`, `instructions`, and output acceptance, so both zones pass
the deletion test without requiring a renderer hierarchy.

Runtime helpers must not import:

- `node:fs`
- `node:path`
- persistence modules
- workflow-resource loaders

The host-work projection must additionally not import entrypoints, Template,
command builders, or output-schema loaders. Approval, stop, and terminal
projection must not import Template or output-schema loaders. Entrypoints must
not dispatch renderer internals.

Output validation in runtime helpers consumes loaded schemas and explicit path
facts. Schema loading, realpath probing, symlink checks, and artifact path facts
belong to adapters or file-contract owners.

Pointer transition projection belongs under runner-owned runtime/use-case
internals, not the dashboard. It derives state-bearing predecessors by resolving
workflow transitions against the persisted baton and must be shared by list and move
validation so inspect-before-mutate output cannot drift from mutation rules.

Non-blocking stop helpers under `lib/runtime/**` own public shaping and
redaction of stop/resolution records. They must receive path facts from the
caller and must not discover workflow-run storage through persistence imports.

Shard runtime helpers own IO-free activation projection, shard output application, bounded batching, and final-worker readiness. They may consume
Workflow, Step, Baton, file contracts, loaded output schemas, and supplied path
facts. They must not import persistence, entrypoints, dashboard code, filesystem
APIs, workflow-resource loaders, host sessions, transcripts, private paths, or
lease-token concerns.

### Persistence

Owner: `lib/persistence/**`

Persistence owns filesystem and durable-state integration:

- workflow resource loading
- run-state records
- locks and leases
- durable commits
- per-run authority records and the global run-catalog projection
- path safety facts
- current migration behavior
- schema loading for persisted/file records

Persistence may depend on DTOs, records, and file contracts. Persistence must
not import use cases.

Persistence must not import entity-owned Baton schema after the schema has a
neutral or narrowly colocated file-contract owner.

### File Contracts And Schemas

Owner: a neutral contract zone or a narrow colocated owner, selected by deletion
proof.

Use a separate file-contract/schema zone only when a durable schema is consumed
by multiple layers or when separating it prevents recurring schema/domain
ownership drift. If one narrow owner is enough, colocate the contract with that
owner.

A file-contract/schema zone must own real contracts, not act as a dumping ground
for constants or pass-through wrappers.

Shard execution adds two durable file-contract surfaces:

- `workflow-document.json` owns the first-class `kind: "shard"` authoring contract.
- Baton schema owns `state.shards` activation snapshots and bounded output references.

These contracts are shared across validation, runtime, persistence validation, tests, and documentation.

Approval steps use a runner-owned, typed contract rather than a
workflow-authored prompt/output-schema pair. `workflow-document.json` owns the
approval input projection: required path-only `summary`, optional ordered
path-only `artifacts`, and optional `verdict` selectors for outcome, concise
summary, and actionable findings with a required route-applicability
`include_when` predicate. Startup semantic validation proves selector type and
cardinality plus guaranteed producer execution before the approval gate. The
dominance check uses the complete executable route graph: static and match-case
edges, schema-expanded dynamic-target edges, and the retarget edges that each
`loopPolicies.onLimit` can introduce. Each selected producer must be reachable
from workflow start, and removing it from that graph must make the gate
unreachable. Approval routing either covers both `output.approval` values or
declares a static `onReject` revision target while `next` owns the approved
route. Validation also proves producer -> critic -> gate/direct-correction
topology before a verdict selector is accepted.

Approval steps declare no output schema. The accepted decision is the closed
runner-owned record `{ approval: "approved" | "rejected", feedback?: string }`;
`feedback`, when present, is bounded and non-blank, and additional properties
are invalid. The runner host-response schema owns action-specific negative
fields and the terminal split: approval requests expose no output-schema or
worker-reuse metadata, while `done` requires one top-level baton and forbids
requests.

### Boundary Checks

Owner: `.dependency-cruiser.cjs`

`.dependency-cruiser.cjs` is the executable source of truth for Orbita source
dependency direction. This document explains the intent and ownership model;
when a dependency rule is concrete enough to enforce, it belongs in
`.dependency-cruiser.cjs` and CI must run it through
`bun run depcruise:check`.

Boundary checks enforce resolved dependency-direction architecture rules. They
should fail recurrence of forbidden imports while avoiding hard failures for
questions that are still unresolved by the architecture contract.

Checks should cover:

- entrypoints importing runtime internals
- CLI entrypoints importing API entrypoints
- lower layers importing entrypoints
- top-level use cases importing other top-level use cases
- entity families importing other entity families, including nested files
- use-case families importing other use-case families, including nested files
- DTO files importing other DTO files
- top-level use cases importing filesystem/path/persistence
- top-level use cases importing catalog readers
- runtime helpers importing filesystem/path/persistence
- host-work projection importing persistence, entrypoints, Node IO, Template,
  command builders, or output-schema loaders
- approval/stop/terminal projection importing Template or output-schema loaders
- entrypoints dispatching renderer internals
- persistence importing use cases
- persistence importing entity-owned Baton schema after migration
- run-state persistence importing startup validation
- runner runtime importing catalog/config discovery
- concrete shard runtime/helper imports that violate the dependency rules below

## Conditional Zones

`lib/file-contracts/**` and `lib/use-cases/internal/**` are conditional zones.
They are allowed only when they own shared policy or durable contract behavior
that survives the deletion test.

Deletion test:

- If deleting the zone only removes folder structure and no caller complexity
  returns, the zone is folder theater and should be removed.
- If deleting the zone pushes shared policy or contract handling back into
  multiple callers or wrong layers, the zone is earning its boundary.

Default to colocation for a single narrow helper or schema.

## Runtime Flow

A canonical workflow-runner command enters through a CLI or API entrypoint. The
entrypoint parses input, coordinates persistence and lease concerns where
needed, and calls a named use-case API.

The use case performs application flow over DTOs/plain values, entity behavior,
IO-free runtime helpers, and supplied contracts. Persistence loads workflow
resources, schemas, run-state records, leases, and path facts, then passes plain
values or contracts across the boundary.

Runtime execution is action-first. The runner resolves neutral executable work,
projects the effective host action from that work plus Baton stop state, renders
only the selected consumer, validates the complete public response, and only
then persists `currentRequests` or Baton changes. This render-before-persist
order keeps failed rendering from committing a cursor/request set that no host
can execute. Worker/fanout/shard rendering still converges on Template through
`run_worker`; approval, unresolved stop, and terminal paths never enter
Template.

Approval projection evaluates `include_when` against the current producer
output before selecting any critic fields. A false predicate omits the stored
verdict entirely; a true predicate may select only the current critic outcome,
concise summary, and actionable findings. Prior approval state is not a
freshness signal. Artifact metadata keeps declared order, is deduplicated after
existing containment/realpath/symlink checks, renders absolute links once, and
never causes artifact body reads.

Entrypoints format current public output and errors. They do not reach into
runtime helper internals to assemble behavior.

Mutating runner commands may carry one command-scoped operation context after
the pre-lock and under-lock authority checks. Its persisted-state snapshot must
be read inside the active per-run lock scope, may be passed into the durable
writer, and is replaced by the validated snapshot returned after each write.
Snapshots are deeply frozen. After a same-scope commit, the writer builds the
replacement from the already validated transition and exact target bytes rather
than rereading and revalidating the complete aggregate. The snapshot is never
cached across commands. A pending durable commit takes
precedence over a supplied snapshot, and any direct history append invalidates
the snapshot before a later aggregate write. This optimization does not change
the split-file topology, recovery order, fsync/atomic-rename guarantees, lease
revalidation, or path/symlink safety.

Durable aggregate writes use the v2 append transaction for `history.md`. The
atomically written pending record contains a unique transaction id, the base
file existence and byte size, the bounded entry text and its SHA-256 hash, and
the requested baton/current-request side effects. It must not embed or rewrite
the complete history. Under the per-run lock, recovery accepts only an unchanged
base, an exact byte prefix of the pending entry, or the complete pending entry;
it completes and fsyncs a partial append, recognizes a complete append without
duplicating it, and fails closed on any unrelated tail, truncation, or invalid
hash. Baton and current-request files retain their atomic-write behavior. The
legacy v1 full-history pending format remains recoverable for commits already in
flight, but new commits must use v2.

The first aggregate commit uses that same pending record as its recovery
authority while `history.md`, `baton.json`, and current requests are all absent.
If journal application fails after any pending/history/baton/current-request
stage, rollback restores those absent-file snapshots but retains the journal,
the run's `running` authority, and the original hashed lease. Failure-history
recording must not consume that journal or clear the lease. A retry with the
same explicit token recovers the retained transaction before normal execution,
materializes all three durable targets once, and removes the journal. Failures
before a pending journal exists have no partial durable commit to recover and
may use the normal new-run failure cleanup.

`history.md` remains the canonical human-facing projection. Commands that only
need baton/current requests carry a file reference plus byte size and do not
load the history body. Full history reads are reserved for behavior that
actually projects history, such as pointer inspection/mutation and debug-note
deduplication. No history body or file handle is cached across commands.

`.workflow-runner/authority.json` is canonical for one run's absolute workflow
binding, claim context, lifecycle/task projection, and token-hash lease record.
Every runner command still validates authority once before taking the per-run
lock and again from a fresh record while holding that lock. Matching-token
renewal preserves the token epoch; an explicit tokenless takeover of a stale or
occupied lease rotates the hash and increments the epoch. Raw lease tokens are
never persisted.

`runs.json` is the global discovery/catalog projection, not an authority source
once a per-run record exists. Warm `next`, `instructions`, `write-output`,
`continue`, and pointer mutation read and atomically renew only the small per-run
record; they do not parse, lock, or rewrite the global catalog. Registration,
explicit claim/heartbeat, and deletion may synchronize the catalog projection.
List and dashboard readers start from catalog ids and overlay canonical per-run
records with bounded IO concurrency. A legacy run without `authority.json` may
fall back to its validated v1 catalog entry; its first successful mutating
runner/claim operation writes the per-run record. Once that file exists, a
missing, conflicting, corrupt, or unsafe authority record must not silently fall
back to the catalog.

Pointer recovery follows the same runtime flow. `listPointerTransitions` checks
the active lease, reads existing persisted run state, builds the shared pointer
transition projection, and returns bounded transition metadata
without initializing missing run files, appending history, renewing authority,
or mutating baton/current pointer state. `movePointer` checks the active lease
before and inside the run-state lock, rebuilds the projection while locked,
validates the requested state-resolved target, updates only baton
cursor/status, validates persisted state, appends bounded pointer-move history,
and renews the canonical per-run authority record.

## Fanout Owner Step

`kind: "fanout"` is the first-class control step for a fixed table of named
worker branches. Authoring selects branches through `input.branches`: a static
branch-id array, one schema-covered input expression, or `first_of` expressions
for selective rework fallback. Each branch is a nested worker template under
`branches.<branch-id>`; branch ids must be globally collision-safe because
accepted branch outputs live at `baton.state[branchId]`.

The top-level cursor remains the fanout owner for the whole activation. Durable
phase and request membership live under `baton.state.fanouts[ownerStepId]` with
the phases `branches`, `owner`, and `completed`. The runner first renders
synthetic branch requests, applies only the current accepted branch outputs,
then renders the genuine owner worker. The owner output is applied through the
normal step output and `next` path. Phase recovery must use this durable record;
request-id parsing, arbitrary state scanning, dispatch workers, and separate
join workers are not valid control flow.

Owner prompt projection includes accepted output only for branches selected in
the current activation. Stale output for unselected branches may remain durable
for audit/history purposes but must not enter the owner prompt. Fanout is a
named workflow-branch primitive; shard is the homogeneous value-partition primitive.

## Shard Workflow Step

`kind: "shard"` is the first-class generic control step for applying one worker
template to a non-empty array of values in parallel. The top-level `input` and
`output` belong to the genuine final worker represented by the shard step;
`worker` is the nested template for parallel shard requests.

`input.shards` accepts either a non-empty literal JSON array or one
schema-covered `input.*` expression that resolves to a non-empty array.
Elements may be arbitrary JSON values. Numeric shard-count shorthand, authored
element ids, branch tables, nested subgraphs, and compatibility aliases are not
part of the contract.

During one activation, the runtime resolves `input.shards` exactly once and
stores the values in order under `baton.state.shards[parentStepId]`.
`baton.cursor` remains the shard step throughout the `shards`, `worker`, and
`completed` phases. Synthetic request ids are activation/index addresses only;
they never become workflow step ids or pointer-recovery targets.

`max_parallel` bounds each current request batch. Accepted worker output remains
once under its synthetic request id. Shard control state stores only a bounded
`output_ref`, request id, index, and status; it never duplicates full output,
prompt, transcript, session, path, token, or host lifecycle data.

Each shard worker receives the normal prompt interpolation context:

- `${{ shard.value }}`
- `${{ shard.index }}`
- `${{ shard.total }}`
- nested paths such as `${{ shard.value.name }}`

These expressions use the same interpolation rendering rules as `input.*`.
The runtime does not append shard values, JSON context, request metadata, or
control instructions to the worker prompt. Only explicitly authored
interpolation reveals a value.

After every shard request is accepted, the runtime renders the genuine worker
represented by the shard step itself. Its schema-valid output follows the normal
`next` transition. There is no dispatch step, aggregation section, deterministic
completion output, or separate completion worker.

## Non-blocking Stops

`baton.nonBlockingStops` is runner-owned durable control-plane state. It is
keyed by active request id and stores only public, bounded stop and resolution
records. It must not contain transcripts, hidden prompts, lease tokens, raw
worker/approval outputs, private workflow-run paths, arbitrary local paths,
credential assignments, or recognizable access keys. Public stop/resolution
text uses a bounded sanitizer that covers absolute, home-relative,
traversal-relative, and `file://` path forms before persistence or projection.

Lifecycle:

- `write-output` accepts only schema-valid completed step output.
- After safe automatic recovery is exhausted, `report-stop` persists a
  sanitized `non_blocking_stop` record without completing the request or
  advancing the cursor. Every new stop carries a worker-generated UUID v4
  `stop_id`. Repeating the exact report with the same id is idempotent;
  conflicting reuse is rejected. A delayed report for a resolved id cannot
  erase its resolution, while a genuinely new stop must use a new id.
- `continue` projects an unresolved record as a
  `resolve_non_blocking_stop` host action. Completed siblings in fanout/shard
  batches remain accepted while the stopped request stays active. Projection
  happens before normal consumer selection, so the matching worker or approval
  renderer is not called while its stop is unresolved.
- `resolve-stop` requires the exact current `stop_id` and persists the bounded
  orchestrator/user resolution on that control record. Exact retries are
  idempotent; conflicting retries and stale resolutions for an older stop are
  rejected without mutation.
- `continue` renders the same request again with resolution context and the
  preferred worker hint when available. Approval recovery receives the same
  bounded resolved context without becoming a Template path. The record is
  cleared only after that request submits normal completed output through
  `write-output`.

Managed history records only the stop id for report/resolve lifecycle events;
it never copies the free-text stop or resolution fields. Those bounded fields
live only in the active Baton control record and are deleted with that record
after normal completed output is accepted.

The final runner statuses remain `needs_host_actions` and `done`. A non-blocking
stop is a host-action pause, never a step outcome, transition value, or terminal
runner status.

## Dashboard Observer Architecture

The Orbita dashboard is a read-only observer over durable `workflow-runner` run
state. It is one small modular monolith deployed as a single TanStack Start
application: Vite builds the React application and Nitro's Bun preset owns the
only dashboard HTTP process. The dashboard is not a runner host adapter, a
durable cache, or a control-plane participant.

`skills/orbita/DESIGN.md` owns the approved board, card, detail, focus,
responsive, and motion laws. `lib/dashboard/CONTEXT.md` owns local placement and
dependency rules. This section records the stable product architecture and
routes readers to those local contracts.

Target request and dependency shape:

```text
durable run files
  -> observer read model (server only, ephemeral)
  -> safe projection + exposure policy (server only)
  -> versioned contracts
  -> TanStack Start GET routes / invalidation SSE
  -> React Query + browser view model
  -> five-lane React board
```

There is no second API daemon, custom static server, generic repository port,
or mixed client/server dashboard barrel. The concrete read-only observer and
the versioned DTO boundary are the only justified seams.

### Dashboard Source Zones

- `lib/dashboard/contracts/**` owns strict runtime schemas, inferred
  browser-safe types, schema versions, the five lane ids/order, public error and
  invalidation enums, identifier bounds, `PublicDisplayText`, and adversarial
  contract fixtures. It imports no dashboard implementation or Node-only code.
- `lib/dashboard/projection/**` owns lane classification, source-specific
  exposure policy, fixed public diagnostics, cursor cardinality enforcement,
  safe summary/detail projection, authored workflow pages, bounded managed
  history, step-path reconstruction, step-scoped Activity/Logs, and artifact
  facts. It is server-only even when helpers are pure.
- `lib/dashboard/observer/**` owns read-only durable adapters, bounded-concurrency
  reads, per-run failure isolation, the process-local `DashboardReadModel`,
  watcher/poll reconciliation, immutable snapshot replacement, freshness
  lifecycle, invalidation subscriptions, and shutdown cleanup.
- `lib/dashboard/ui/**` is the TanStack Start application root. Its explicit
  `.server.ts` composition and API route files may reach the observer; its
  client-reachable routes, features, components, hooks, and primitives may
  import only browser-safe contracts and browser libraries.
- `lib/entrypoints/**` does not export, wrap, or serve dashboard APIs. Root Bun
  scripts are the supported development/build/start/check surface.

These zones are real responsibility owners, not folder ceremony: deleting
`contracts` duplicates the cross-runtime schema; deleting `projection` smears
classification/disclosure into readers and routes; deleting `observer` smears
durable reads and lifecycle into transport; deleting `ui` removes the product
and Start deployment. Do not add a generic service/repository/shared-utility
zone for one implementation.

### Dashboard Records and Authority

Dashboard projection is a read-model context. It owns allowlisted DTOs and
classification policy for `Waiting for user`, `Worker running`, `Needs help`,
`Degraded`, and `Done`. It may expose bounded, redacted history excerpts and
artifact metadata, but it must not expose raw baton, raw history, compiled
instructions, private prompts, token-bearing commands, hidden transcripts,
instruction storage paths, preferred worker agent ids, worker binding flags, or
unnecessary host control-plane metadata.

Durable run files remain the only authority. `SnapshotEnvelope`,
`ObserverFreshnessDTO`, `RunSummaryDTO`, `RunLightDetailDTO`, workflow/history/
artifact pages, `InvalidationEvent`, `PublicDisplayText`, and the browser board
store are records/read models, not domain entities. `DashboardReadModel` has
process identity and lifecycle but is ephemeral, immutable per published
revision, fully rebuildable, and forbidden from writing cache data into run
directories.

Run inspection introduces no durable execution identity. The selected workflow
`stepId` is only a browser/read-model key. The ordered path, Activity, managed
debug-summary logs, and artifact ownership are derived from the existing Baton,
managed history, workflow document, and artifact records. Fanout/shard request
ids remain request addresses and may be mapped to their owning workflow step for
display; they never become workflow steps or new persisted entities. Workflow is
run-wide; selecting a step scopes only Activity, Logs, and Artifacts.

The projection exposes exactly five observer lanes in stable order:

1. `waiting_for_user`
2. `worker_running`
3. `needs_help`
4. `degraded`
5. `done`

`Degraded` means observer/read health and is never persisted as workflow state.
Current cursor cardinality is `0..1`. The DTO may retain an array shape, but a
projection with more than one current step is an explicit bounded unsupported/
degraded result, never fabricated fanout.

All browser-visible prose must be produced by exposure policy version `2` for
one of the implemented source classes: run title/summary, workflow identity,
step id, artifact id/summary, result summary/ref, or history line. The policy
normalizes with NFKC, replaces control characters with spaces, collapses
whitespace, applies the source's 120/160/240-code-point ceiling, and omits the
value when it matches an absolute path, secret/token/hash shape, runner/shell
command, private-instruction marker, prompt, or transcript. The shared
`PublicDisplayText` schema then enforces non-empty text with a maximum length of
240. New prose source classes default to omission. Identifiers/enums use their
dedicated bounded schemas; raw durable records and raw exception messages never
cross the route boundary. The 1.5 MiB snapshot and 64 KiB detail response caps
are the implemented aggregate UTF-8 byte boundaries; there is no separate
per-field byte-limit contract.

### Versioned HTTP and Reconciliation Contract

The Start application exposes the same-origin v2 GET surface:

- `/api/dashboard/v2/runs` and `/api/dashboard/v2/runs/:runId` return the
  validated summary snapshot and light run detail.
- `/api/dashboard/v2/runs/:runId/workflow` and `traversal` return the authored
  graph and current ordered step path.
- `/api/dashboard/v2/runs/:runId/activity`, `logs`, and `artifacts` require one
  validated existing workflow `stepId`.
- `/api/dashboard/v2/runs/:runId/artifacts/:artifactRef` streams one validated
  preview/download artifact.
- `/api/dashboard/v2/events` streams bounded invalidation envelopes and
  heartbeat comments.

The server and browser contracts ship atomically under one schema version. SSE
is a lossy hint, never a state transition or authority: events may be dropped,
duplicated, delayed, reordered, or reset. The SSE frame carries a bounded
invalidation envelope and revision id; it carries no run-state data.
`snapshot_changed` publication is coalesced to the configured interval, while
stale/recovered events publish immediately. The browser ignores invalid or
non-increasing ids, coalesces query invalidation to one signal per 100ms, resets
sequence tracking and refetches after reconnect, and also performs a normal
validated snapshot GET every 15 seconds. `If-None-Match` remains a supported
route contract for other same-origin callers; the current browser fetch adapter
does not send a conditional header.

`DashboardReadModel` owns both the last-good immutable runs and authoritative
observer freshness. A successful refresh increments revision, atomically
publishes a validated snapshot, records the attempt as the last success, resets
the failure count, and emits `snapshot_changed` or `observer_recovered`. A
failure before any good snapshot leaves no published revision and returns the
bounded first-load error. A failure after a good snapshot increments revision,
retains its runs and last-success time, preserves the original `staleSince`,
increments `consecutiveFailures`, sets the fixed
`observer_refresh_failed` diagnostic, advances the ETag, and emits
`observer_stale`; only a later successful refresh clears stale.

The browser may display Live only when authoritative observer freshness is
`fresh`, no newer `observer_stale` event hint is pending reconciliation, and
EventSource is connected. Connected EventSource alone is never proof of fresh
data. `ORBITA_DASHBOARD_STALE_MS` bounds the server's full-refresh cadence by
making the effective polling interval `min(POLL_MS, STALE_MS)`; the current
browser does not derive freshness from elapsed age. Snapshot failure cannot
render as empty success; detail failure remains local to the detail surface;
one corrupt run becomes one Degraded summary without hiding healthy runs.

Request authority is explicit. Process configuration alone selects the runs
root. The validated snapshot revision owns summary/freshness state. The
router's `run` search value owns detail selection; React Query keys detail data
by that exact id, the fetch adapter URL-encodes it, and the route decodes and
validates it before exact index lookup. Filtered or missing selection retains
the id and never authorizes fallback to the first or neighboring run.

```

Binding rules:

- Client-reachable UI modules must not import `observer/**`, `projection/**`,
  persistence, entrypoints, runtime/use-cases/entities, Node built-ins, process
  environment, or any `.server.ts` module.
- `contracts/**` must not import a dashboard implementation zone or Node-only
  module.
- `projection/**` may import contracts and validated plain records; it must not
  import filesystem/process APIs, Start routes, watchers, leases, writers,
  runner mutation/control APIs, or UI modules.
- `observer/**` may import approved read-only persistence, projection,
  contracts, and read/watch APIs; it must not import writers, locks/leases,
  mutation/control APIs, CLI shells, host lifecycle, or UI/browser modules.
- Start server routes may reach observer code only through one explicit
  server-only composition module. Routes do not classify lanes, redact values,
  parse durable state, or expose raw errors.
- No dashboard module may import or construct `next`, `continue`,
  `write-output`, `instructions`, `movePointer`, `listPointerTransitions`,
  claim/lease/bind-agent, repair/retry-run, or manual-move surfaces.
- Tests cross the same contracts used by callers: schemas/projection, observer
  service, HTTP routes, React behavior, and browser flows. Reaching through a
  seam to private state is not a substitute.

`.dependency-cruiser.cjs` and production client-bundle inspection are hard
mechanical gates for these rules. The bundle must contain no Node, persistence,
observer, projection, workflow-runner, lease/control, private environment,
path, prompt, token, or transcript implementation material.

### Compatibility, Operations, and Architecture Memory

The prototype compatibility decision is `delete_now`. The final implementation
contains no `listDashboardRuns`, `getDashboardRun`, `startDashboardServer`,
`orbita-dashboard serve`, custom Node HTTP server, string renderer, direct
dashboard assets, whole-snapshot SSE, `/api/runs`, `/api/events`, unversioned
`/api/dashboard/*`, or redirects/wrappers for them. Durable workflow-runner
formats and mutation/control APIs remain unchanged.

Process configuration owns runs root, loopback host/port, poll/reconciliation,
coalescing, and stale intervals. Browser routes cannot choose a filesystem path.
The supported command and configuration surface is documented in
`lib/dashboard/README.md`.

Server composition is a process-local lazy singleton created by the first API
request. Creation starts one watcher when available and one periodic refresh
timer. `close()` is idempotent and clears the watcher, poll/watch/invalidation
timers, and subscribers; the current composition registers that close on
`beforeExit`. Each SSE request separately clears its heartbeat and unsubscribes
on request abort or stream cancellation. Do not claim a broader signal-hook
contract without production evidence for that hook.

Architecture artifact decision: `update_existing`. This section,
`lib/dashboard/CONTEXT.md`, `DESIGN.md`, and `.dependency-cruiser.cjs` must stay
consistent with routes, schemas, tests, commands, and rendered behavior. No ADR
is added because these existing owning artifacts already record the decision.
Contract/docs drift is blocker-level.

Source rollback restores the previous complete source revision; there is no
merged dual server/UI fallback and no data migration because durable run formats
do not change. Failure of Bun Start/SSE/shutdown, freshness truth, disclosure or
bundle boundaries, accessibility/focus, or approved performance gates reopens
the approved architecture rather than silently weakening it.

### Workflow Loop Policies

Workflow loop limits are an opt-in workflow-document contract. A workflow may
declare `loopPolicies` to bound valid semantic cycles such as review -> fix ->
review or approval -> revision -> approval. Workflows without `loopPolicies`
must validate and run with unchanged behavior.

The intended shape is policy-metadata first:

- the workflow document owns policy definitions;
- validation expands a finite route graph from literal `next`, `match/cases`,
  approval/user routes, and schema-enumerable dynamic `next` expressions;
- each policy explicitly declares its cycle members in `steps`; validation
  proves that the induced declared-step graph is cyclic instead of expanding
  the policy to a maximal SCC from the full workflow graph;
- external routes may place the declared cycle inside a larger graph cycle
  without changing the policy's declared members;
- each policy declares one iteration `entry` and one `boundary`; validation
  proves all entries, repeats, and exits respect those boundaries;
- runtime increments progress once when a complete entry-to-boundary traversal
  finishes, not for each internal edge;
- after `maxIterations` complete traversals, a selected boundary-to-entry repeat
  resolves `onLimit` as an independent transition descriptor with the same
  expression forms and boundary context as `next`, only after normal `next`
  selected a repeat that reached the limit; its routing may differ from
  `boundary.next`, but every possible result must already be a declared external
  target of the boundary step, so runtime never creates a synthetic edge;
- any declared external target selected before the boundary repeat remains a
  normal early exit; an incomplete traversal does not advance progress;
- baton stores only loop progress counters in a loop-specific namespace, never
  workflow policy definitions.

Loop policies are separate from worker `output.schema` retry. Invalid worker
output retried by output-schema validation must not increment loop policy
progress. Invalid approval decisions are rejected by the closed runner-owned
contract and do not enter workflow output-schema retry. The retry key shape
`<stepId>:output.schema` remains reserved for worker output-schema attempts;
loop policy progress must use a distinct namespace.

Rejected primary models:

- per-transition `cycleId` labels;
- runtime-inferred loop membership that overrides the workflow policy;
- runtime history, repeated cursor, backward-jump, or graph traversal heuristics;
- prompt-only loop limits.

Consecutive pass/success early exit is not part of the first loopPolicies
architecture slice. Do not document or implement it as available behavior unless
a later approved architecture contract adds reset, precedence, and success
target semantics.

Parallel/fanout support is conservative for the first slice. A policy that
depends on ambiguous branch-local, cross-branch, non-convergent, or
non-enumerable fanout routing must fail validation instead of being guessed at
runtime.

## Dependency Rules

Allowed:

- `entrypoints -> use-cases`
- `entrypoints -> persistence`
- `use-cases -> entities`
- `use-cases -> runtime helpers`
- `use-cases -> file contracts`
- `runtime helpers -> entities`
- `runtime helpers -> file contracts`
- host-work projection -> plain workflow/Baton records, step-action policy,
  and public stop shaping
- approval projection -> typed state selection, supplied artifact path facts,
  redaction, runner approval contract, and command builders
- `persistence -> DTOs/records/file contracts`
- Workflow loop policy validation may depend on workflow contracts, output
  schema target enumerability, route graph expansion, and declared-cycle
  connectivity; it must not depend on baton history or host adapter state.
- Runtime loop policy enforcement may depend on compiled validation metadata,
  the selected valid route event, and baton progress counters; it must not own
  workflow policy definitions.
- Baton schema may define loop progress storage, but workflow schema remains
  the policy source of truth.

- shard runtime/entity helpers -> `node:fs`
- shard runtime/entity helpers -> `node:path`
- shard runtime/entity helpers -> persistence
- shard runtime/entity helpers -> entrypoints
- shard runtime/entity helpers -> dashboard
- persistence -> shard runtime/use-case helpers
- supported command paths or exports for retired legacy surfaces
- dashboard code mutating run state, acquiring leases, invoking runner
  navigation/output/pointer-recovery commands, or exposing private runner
  control data through browser-visible DTOs

## Review Gates

Architecture review must verify:

- the changed source still reveals the layer model
- retired surfaces are absent from supported paths
- no new compatibility wrapper is introduced under a different name
- helper/schema zones are colocated unless shared ownership pressure is proven
- docs, checks, and source agree on supported command surface and dependency
  rules
- executable entries remain text-free, unresolved stops are selected before
  rendering, and only effective `run_worker` reaches Template
- the approval owner is the single typed selection/decision boundary, verdict
  inclusion is proven by current route applicability, every selected producer
  dominates the gate across static, match-case, schema-expanded dynamic, and
  loop-policy `onLimit` edges, and no approval prompt, output schema, Template
  branch, compatibility wrapper, or deprecated export survives
- first-commit failure recovery retains the absent-file v2 journal and original
  lease authority until same-token recovery materializes history, baton, and
  current requests atomically
- full-JSON `done` has one top-level baton and no requests, while terminal
  instruction text has no baton, serialized response, or next runner command
- pointer recovery docs, API exports, CLI modes, tests, and source agree that
  `listPointerTransitions` and `movePointer` require active lease authority,
  preserve baton state, derive predecessors from workflow transitions resolved
  against `baton.state`, never use debug history as navigation state, reject
  invalid legacy array cursor state, and expose only redacted bounded metadata
- dashboard changes preserve the read-only observer boundary, safe projection
  layer, SSE/poll recovery behavior, degraded per-run isolation, and
  `DESIGN.md` board/drawer/no-control contract
- dashboard tests or boundary checks prove browser DTOs exclude private
  runner/control fields and dashboard code does not import or call runner
  mutation/control surfaces
- shard docs, workflow schema, Baton schema, runtime behavior, tests, and boundary checks agree on the first-class `kind: "shard"` contract and `state.shards` ownership
- shard execution keeps `baton.cursor` on the parent step, snapshots values once, batches by activation/index, stores bounded output references, and runs the genuine final step worker
- shard DTO and prompt tests prove values appear only through explicitly authored interpolation and public request context excludes raw values, prompts, transcripts, private paths, and standalone token fields

Backend review must verify:

- canonical `next`, `instructions`, `write-output`, `report-stop`,
  `resolve-stop`, and `continue` behavior remains coherent
- output validation, artifact metadata handling, run-state persistence, leases,
  history, and current migration semantics did not change accidentally
- imports obey the dependency rules above
- `instructions --step-id` returns the current worker or approval projection
  and rejects stop-superseded, terminal, missing, and stale requests before
  renewing the lease
- accepted approval output is exactly `approved|rejected` plus optional bounded
  non-blank `feedback`; rejection routes through `output.approval` or a static
  `onReject` target, and approval never invokes a workflow output-schema loader
- custom workflow roots validate before run creation, retain source-qualified
  catalog identity, and do not widen resource access by duplicate workflow name
- shard `input.shards` expansion snapshots arbitrary JSON values once, restart rerenders the durable current batch, accepted outputs remain single primary records, and final worker output follows normal `next`
- existing sequential, fanout, worker output-schema, lease,
  artifact/debug-summary, history, worker binding, and non-blocking-stop
  behavior remains compatible; approval prompt/schema variants are an
  intentional atomic breaking migration with no compatibility layer

QA/reliability review must verify:

- focused workflow-runner checks cover canonical command behavior
- boundary checks fail resolved forbidden imports and retired-surface exposure
- retired legacy names are absent from supported command paths, exports, docs,
  and allow lists
- shard workflow tests cover literal and dynamic arrays, arbitrary JSON values, explicit value/index/total interpolation, absent implicit JSON injection, batching, durable resume, bounded output references, genuine final worker execution, invalid empty/non-array inputs, and fanout regressions

Security and privacy review must verify:

- artifact path handling remains constrained to approved run artifact
  directories
- run-state, lease, history, and output records do not expose new private data
  surfaces while ownership moves
- shard values are durably snapshotted only as required for resume, omitted from public request DTOs, and rendered into prompts only through explicit interpolation

## Non-Goals

- Preserve backward compatibility for obsolete legacy entrypoints, aliases, or
  wrappers.
- Redesign the current public workflow-runner protocol beyond removing obsolete
  surfaces from supported architecture.
- Change host lifecycle semantics for the canonical current runner surface.
- Keep `start-run`, `persist-run-state`, or `workflow-interpreter` as temporary
  exceptions.
- Add broad framework seams where a narrow colocated helper or named use-case
  API is enough.
- Add brittle boundary rules for ownership questions that remain unresolved.
- Add numeric shard-count shorthand, compatibility aliases, optional/fail-fast policy, branch tables, nested per-value subgraphs, distributed child runs, dashboard mutation behavior, or pointer-recovery mutation for synthetic shard requests.
