# sharp-edges

Portable adaptation of Trail of Bits guidance. Read the selected skill by path and keep its references and reusable helpers together. Native plugin manifests, commands, hooks, UI metadata, runtime orchestration, and plugin-only evaluation harnesses have been removed. The analysis methods and supporting material are retained; this version does not inherit the original plugin runtime or benchmark guarantees.
