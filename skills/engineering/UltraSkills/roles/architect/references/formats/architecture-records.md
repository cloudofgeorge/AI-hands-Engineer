# Architecture Records

Architecture records are the repo's durable memory for structural decisions, boundaries, and placement rules.

Typical records include `ARCHITECTURE.md`, local `CONTEXT.md`, `CONTEXT-MAP.md`, ADRs, and other named architecture contracts.

## Use it when

- the important part of the change is hard to recover later from code alone
- ownership, dependency rules, or artifact obligations need durable discovery
- a central index should route readers to local owning records

## Key rule

Central docs route and index. Local context docs own local rules.
