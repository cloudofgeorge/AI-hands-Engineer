# Change Classification

Change classification decides how much architecture involvement the slice deserves.

## Useful buckets

- **local** — stays within one owned module or context, with no architecture record pressure
- **design-level** — changes an interface or seam inside existing ownership
- **architecture/structural** — changes boundaries, ownership, dependency rules, runtime shape, or durable architecture records
- **mixed** — implementation work with a real structural side effect

Use this to right-size the architecture pass instead of treating every edit like a redesign.
