# <Project/Issue> UI Intent Contract — <Surface>

Use this after approved research and before architecture when a task may affect user-facing UI. This is a product-surface contract, not code architecture and not durable design law.

## Artifact Metadata

- Owner:
- Date:
- Source artifacts:
- UI gate decision: Applicable | Not applicable
- Reason:

## Source Research

<Link or summarize the approved research requirements and evidence that shape the UI surface. Do not add new implementation scope.>

## UI Applicability

State whether this task needs a UI intent gate.

- **Applicable** when the task creates or materially changes screens, flows, visible states, navigation, forms, lists/tables/cards, overlays, interaction patterns, visual hierarchy, density, or user-facing copy that affects task comprehension.
- **Not applicable** when the task is backend-only, non-UI plumbing, trivial copy, invisible bug fix, or preserves an existing UI shape with no meaningful surface decision.

## Product / Surface Routing

Route the surface before describing it. Use repo-local design law first; do not infer a project class from vibes.

- `DESIGN.md` / design-memory status: Present | Missing | Weak | Contradictory | Not checked because not applicable
- Surface type: Dashboard | Admin panel | Marketing site | Docs site | App shell | Mixed product | Undeclared
- Evidence for route: <DESIGN.md section, existing screen, README/product brief, route names, screenshots, task acceptance criteria>
- Portable guidance allowed: <which frontend-taste/project-routing guidance can be used, if any>
- Must not infer: <project class, palette, density, tone, visual direction, component family, etc.>
- Required design-law repair or `create-design` routing: <none, or the smallest concrete routing need>

## User Task

- Primary user:
- User job:
- Primary action:
- Secondary actions:
- Success signal:

## User Questions / Decisions

Record the questions the user would naturally ask or need to answer before a frontend implementer commits to the surface. Prefer concrete, user-facing questions over hidden assumptions.

| Question / decision | Why it matters for the UI | Current answer / assumption | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <question about workflow, priority, data, density, visual proof, interaction, or risk> | <what changes in the screen if answered differently> | <answered from research/design law, assumed conservatively, or unknown> | Answered | Assumed | Needs user approval |

If an unanswered question materially changes layout, primary action, risk posture, density, or visual direction, return blocked/reroute instead of guessing.

## Screen / Surface Structure

| Zone | Purpose | Primary content/actions | Notes / constraints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <toolbar/header/filter/list/detail/form/dialog/etc.> | <why this zone exists> | <what it must contain> | <constraints, if any> |

## First Read / Work Surface

- What the user should understand in the first 3 seconds:
- Primary work surface and reading order:
- Most important visual/action priority:
- Secondary information and where it should live:
- Range / viewport behavior for dense or horizontal surfaces:
- Dangerous or irreversible actions:
- What must not compete for attention:

## Required States

| State | Required surface behavior | Recovery / next action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Loading / pending | <visible expectation> | <if any> |
| Empty | <visible expectation> | <one clear next action> |
| Error | <visible expectation> | <retry/recovery> |
| Success / confirmation | <visible expectation> | <if any> |
| Disabled / permission / partial data | <visible expectation> | <if relevant> |

## Interaction Expectations

- Navigation / routing:
- Forms / validation:
- Modal / drawer / popover / menu behavior:
- Keyboard / focus expectations:
- Responsive expectations:
- Motion expectations:

## Design Basis Preflight

- Existing `DESIGN.md` / design memory:
- Existing UI/screens/components to preserve:
- Prior design reviews or approved visual direction:
- References or product examples, if used:
- Density / tone:
- Missing or weak design-law areas:
- Blocker threshold: <why current basis is enough for this slice, or why the workflow should block/reroute>

## Visual Evidence / Proof Assets

Use this section to carry the design artifact that frontend can implement against. Include existing screenshots, approved reference images, generated mockups, proof pages, or explicit gaps. Do not invent visual law from images alone.

| Asset | Type | Source / path / URL | What it proves | How frontend should use it |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <current screen / approved direction / reference / proof page / mockup> | Screenshot / reference / generated image / demo / none | <artifact/path/link or "missing"> | <layout, density, state, tone, component behavior, etc.> | <preserve, compare against, ignore specific parts, capture after implementation, etc.> |

## Rendered Proof Expectation

- Required for this task: Yes | No
- Expected proof: <desktop screenshot, mobile screenshot, state screenshots, Storybook/demo page, Playwright capture, or explicit reason none is needed>
- Minimum states to capture:
- If proof cannot be captured locally:

If high-confidence visual direction is required and no `DESIGN.md`, existing screen, reference, screenshot, or approved proof exists, return blocked or route to `create-design` / Frontend-Taste direction work instead of guessing.

## Open UI Tensions For Architecture

List UI constraints architecture must preserve without deciding visual taste:

- <state ownership pressure, route/state tension, data dependency, interaction edge case, or surface constraint>

## Non-goals

- <What this UI intent does not decide, especially file paths, component filenames, hooks, storage boundaries, or durable design-law changes.>

## Template Rules

- Do not define code structure, file paths, component names, hooks, or state-storage ownership; architecture and planning own those.
- Do not author or repair `DESIGN.md`; if durable design law is missing and required, return blocked/reroute instead of guessing.
- Keep the contract concrete enough that architecture and planning can preserve the intended surface without inventing UI from scratch.
