# Execution Plan Contract

Use this after research has produced a human-approved `reasons-canvas-research` artifact and, when the architecture gate runs, after Architect has produced the active successor contract. For tiny work, this may be a compact one-paragraph or short-bullet version of the same contract.

Execution planning must be concrete enough for implementation shape, ownership, verification, and rollback. It must not become code, pseudocode, algorithms, edit recipes, or a patch plan.

## Contract

- Goal:
- Non-goals:
- Upstream evidence: `reasons-canvas-research` reference plus any carried-forward artifact lineage
- Active planning basis: approved `reasons-canvas-research` if no architecture gate ran / approved Architect output when architecture ran
- Structural contract: none / reference to Architect output
- REASONS architecture artifact: none / reference to `reasons-canvas-architecture`
- Project baseline: `not-required` / `required` + current docs, meaningful source ownership zones, and gaps/deferred items
- Architecture artifact manifest: existing / required / deferred project artifacts (`ARCHITECTURE.md`, meaningful source-zone `CONTEXT.md`, ADR/migration docs, and `DESIGN.md` when UI/frontend surface is material)
- Architecture-artifact decision: `none` / `update_existing` / `create_new` + target artifact when applicable
- Proposal workspace: `none` / explicit `.proposals/<feature-slug>` request + gitignore status + cleanup/publish hygiene
- File zones:
- Implementer owners:
- Implementation entities:
- Reviewer roles:
- Reviewer plan:
- Delegation prompt contract: shared delegated role task template from [../../../shared/delegate/delegated-role-task-template.md](../../../shared/delegate/delegated-role-task-template.md) plus selected role material path, compact role/focus block, and concrete approved task packet/scope/verification expectations for Architect, Planner, implementer, and reviewer workers; real worker prompts must fill template placeholders with concrete approved values; each required worker must follow loaded role material and satisfy its additional, final-answer, or output requirements or be treated as `blocked`
- Acceptance criteria:
- Design-test: required/not-required/unknown (draft-only before approval) + why
- Design-test scope: intended UI shape, required components, critical states/behavior, detail expectations
- Verification surfaces:
- Rollback surfaces:
- Documentation impact: `none` / `required`
- Documentation surfaces: file headers / public API docs / data-shape docs / lifecycle-or-invariant docs / contract notes
- Contract/docs drift surfaces: `none` / required + changed user-visible/runtime contracts, artifacts, schemas, workflow/state-machine records, symbolic lifecycle/status values, review/process contracts, and expected docs/tests/source-contract artifacts
- Final Architect drift gate: `not-required` / `required` + expected docs/tests/source-contract artifacts and reviewer assignment or approved exception
- Docs blocker threshold: `blocker` / `should-fix`
- Explicit handoff notes:
- Durable follow-up items:
- Risks:
- Sensitive surface: yes/no + why
- Sensitive inputs:
- Persistence:
- Exposure surface:
- Request-path impact:
- Contract touchpoints:
- Docs to update:
- Architecture notes: structural contract reference, project baseline, artifact manifest, seam decisions, file-zone rationale, request-path boundaries, dependency decisions
- architecture_decision: selected structural direction when Architect ran
- domain_source_proof_map: `none` / required + concept classifications, owners, allowed/forbidden paths, entrypoints, invariants/lifecycle or non-domain reasons, schema/durable owners, compatibility decisions, negative checks, reviewer gates
- source_layout_owner_map: owning contexts/modules and allowed source zones
- runtime_path_map: request/runtime/entrypoint paths affected by the slice
- schema_domain_ownership_map: schemas, records, durable fields, workflow states, gates, artifacts, packets, verdicts, and their owners
- compatibility_surface_plan: deprecated exports, wrappers, aliases, legacy imports + decision (`delete_now`, `keep_temporarily`, `public_exception`), owner, expiry/removal condition, imports to update, negative check
- deletion_migration_plan: fake-module/deletion proof, file/module removals, migration exceptions, and what breaks if a retained module is deleted
- forbidden_placements_imports: binding no-go paths, layers, imports, and naming placements
- expected_file_moves: source/docs/test moves expected or explicitly not expected
- verification_surfaces: positive and negative checks proving structure, deletion, imports, docs/schema alignment, and compatibility decisions
- reviewer_gates: required Architect/Critic/reviewer checks, including proof-map and negative-check verdict fields
- known_exceptions_with_expiry: approved temporary exceptions, owner, expiry/removal condition, and follow-up surface

## Implementation entities

Implementation entities are planner-level handoff objects. They describe what implementation must account for without prescribing exact code.

Allowed kinds include:

- `module`
- `class`
- `function`
- `component`
- `config_key`
- `schema`
- `adapter`
- `route`
- `command`
- `doc_artifact`
- `contract_surface`
- `migration`

Each entity should include:

- `kind`
- `name`
- `responsibility`
- `inputs`
- `outputs`
- `integration_point`
- `file_zone`
- `verification_surface`
- `rollback_surface`
- `source_or_evidence`

Per-entity `rollback_surface` entries roll up into top-level `Rollback surfaces`, which summarizes the concrete revert or containment surfaces across the whole slice.

## Project baseline and artifact manifest

`project_baseline` is required for new project, new repo, new plugin, and architecture-sensitive work. Keep it factual and short: existing product/project docs, existing architecture/design docs, meaningful source ownership zones, relevant absence/gaps, and what is explicitly deferred. Do not turn this into Project Scaffold; scaffold work remains out of scope unless separately approved.

The architecture artifact manifest names durable artifacts that must exist, be updated, or stay deferred for the slice:

- `ARCHITECTURE.md` for selected product architecture contract and routing when required.
- Source-focused `CONTEXT.md` only for meaningful source ownership zones with real placement/dependency rules. Tests, scripts, fixtures, and tooling do not get context docs by default.
- ADRs or migration docs when the slice carries durable decision or migration pressure.
- `DESIGN.md` status when UI/frontend surface is material: existing, required through design-memory work, or explicitly out of scope/deferred. DevHarness records the condition; it does not silently implement a design or project scaffold.

Architecture artifact work may be assigned to `architect` as an artifact implementer owner. That owner is distinct from architect review and from `backend`/`frontend` code owners; it owns approved architecture artifacts only, not application code.

## Proposal workspace policy

`.proposals/` is opt-in only by explicit Sergey/user request. When approved, use exactly `.proposals/<feature-slug>/{research.md,architecture.md,implementation.md}` and ensure `.proposals/` is gitignored in the target repo. Treat these files as temporary planning workspace, not final product docs or publishable artifacts. Root `plan.md`, `architecture-proposal.md`, `implementation-proposal.md`, or other implementation proposal leftovers fail publish/PR hygiene unless explicitly approved.

Terminology:

- Researcher owns `domain_vocabulary` and known facts/evidence.
- Architect owns `structural_entities`, relationships, dependency rules, final structural contract, classification/ownership rules, proof maps, compatibility surface decisions, and forbidden placements/imports.
- Execution planning owns `implementation_entities` and worker handoff. Planner may add implementation entities needed to execute the slice, but must not drop or weaken Architect-owned classification, ownership, source-layout, schema/domain, compatibility, deletion, or reviewer-gate rules.

## Planner dual-pass

For non-trivial work:

1. `Planner A propose`: creates the execution contract from the nearest approved upstream contract. If architecture ran, consume the Architect-owned structural contract and `reasons-canvas-architecture` when present; research is trace evidence, not a competing active contract.
2. `Planner B attack`: challenges implementation entity coverage, file-zone ownership, project baseline coverage, architecture artifact manifest, proposal-workspace hygiene, verification surfaces, rollback surfaces, sensitive surfaces, request-path/contract touchpoints, risks, and max-detail leaks.
3. Allow one bounded revise/re-review loop when the attack finds fixable gaps, unless the caller explicitly approves another.

This is the same planner role/class in an attack pass, not a separate role.

## Rules

- For non-trivial work, execution planning may start only after the required upstream gates are approved: research approval first, then architecture approval when the architecture gate ran. Planning consumes the nearest approved upstream contract.
- One agent per file zone.
- Code implementer owners must use only `backend` or `frontend` as the role label. `architect` is allowed only as an architecture artifact implementer owner for approved docs/artifacts, not backend/frontend code.
- Each owner must map to one closed, exclusive file zone. No file may belong to two owners.
- `Feature slice` is not a free-form label; use it only if it resolves to one closed file set with one owner.
- If the work cannot be partitioned cleanly, collapse ownership to one implementer instead of inventing pseudo-slices.
- One PR per semantic chunk.
- No same agent/pass may own both implementation and reviewer/critic work for the same slice. If `architect` implements architecture artifacts, architect review must be a separate reviewer pass.
- Reviewer role labels are separate from implementer labels; the only label shared across phases is `architect` for approved architecture artifact implementation, and it remains distinct from architect review.
- Freeze scope once the contract is agreed.
- If UI, interaction behavior, or component composition is materially part of the slice, the contract must explicitly say whether a `design-test` is required before implementation and whether repo `DESIGN.md` exists, is required, or is explicitly deferred/out of scope.
- For approved UI-relevant plans, `Design-test` may not stay `unknown`; resolve it to `required` or `not-required` before implementation handoff.
- When required, `design-test` should be concrete enough to guide later implementation/review: intended UI shape, required components, critical states/behavior, and notable detail expectations.
- If `Sensitive surface` is yes or uncertain, fill all sensitive-data fields before approval.
- If the slice stores or reuses user-provided data, the contract must say whether storage is one-shot or persistent, and whether explicit user consent is required.
- If the slice touches backend request-path, persistence, or async runtime behavior, the contract must say whether blocking sync I/O exists on the request path, which contract/request-shape surfaces can drift, and which docs/architecture notes must stay in sync.
- For non-trivial code changes, the contract must explicitly name which changed files require file-level headers, which exported/public surfaces require language-appropriate code docs, and which invariants, side effects, lifecycle details, or contract assumptions must stay documented in code.
- If an Architect pass ran, its structural contract, file-zone and seam conclusions, dependency rules, project baseline, artifact manifest, artifact decision, proof map, owner maps, compatibility surface plan, deletion/migration plan, forbidden placements/imports, verification surfaces, reviewer gates, and known exceptions with expiry must be captured in the contract rather than left implicit in chat.
- If `Contract/docs drift surfaces` is non-empty, final review must include Architect unless an explicit approved exception assigns that contract class to another reviewer. The final gate must state whether the drift check is required or not required and name the expected docs/tests/source-contract artifacts.
- Full architecture process/package work must route through `create-architecture`; DevHarness's Architect gate is only a planning-time structural contract for an implementation slice.
- If `.proposals/` exists in scope, the contract must prove it was explicitly requested, is gitignored, follows `.proposals/<feature-slug>/{research.md,architecture.md,implementation.md}`, and will not be treated as final product documentation.

## Max-detail guardrails

Before approval, the execution plan must not include:

- exact signatures
- pseudocode
- algorithms
- code blocks
- class/function skeletons
- exact file-by-file edit recipes
- patch-like diffs
- migration bodies
- implementation command sequences
- generated source/config snippets

A valid plan says what implementation must preserve and integrate with; it does not tell the implementer exactly how to write the patch.

## Output

- Short plan
- Project baseline and architecture artifact manifest when required
- Proposal workspace decision and cleanup/publish hygiene
- Owner-to-zone map
- Implementation entities
- Reviewer roles and reviewer plan
- Role-load contract plus any additional, final-answer, or output requirements for delegated workers
- Explicit handoff notes
- Verification surfaces
- Rollback surfaces
- Documentation impact, documentation surfaces, and docs blocker threshold when code documentation is part of the done contract
- Contract/docs drift surfaces
- Final Architect drift gate
- Durable follow-up items
- Design-test decision when UI is materially in scope
- Architecture artifact decision and structural contract reference when applicable

## Tiny-task compact form

For tiny, obvious, low-risk work, the execution plan may be compressed to a short form that still names:

- goal
- file zone
- owner
- acceptance check
- rollback surfaces or revert strategy
- architecture artifact decision, usually `none`
- project baseline only when the tiny task is new-project/new-repo/new-plugin work or touches architecture artifacts

Tiny work does not skip the stage; it uses a compact version of it.
