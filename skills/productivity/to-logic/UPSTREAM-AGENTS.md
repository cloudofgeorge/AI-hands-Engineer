# Authoring & maintaining the `to-logic` skill

Agent guide for working **inside this skill repository**. Read it before editing `SKILL.md`, the README,
or any plugin manifest.

> Naming (Russian): the adjective for "agent / agentic" is **«агентный»**, never «агентский».

## Repository layout

This skill is packaged for **Claude Code**, **Cursor**, and **OpenAI Codex** (and installs as a plain
skill folder for Kimi Code CLI and others).

```

├─ .cursor-plugin/

## ⚠️ Golden rule: a change anywhere must be synced across the whole skill

The same facts (the skill text, its `version`, its `description`) are duplicated in several files so the
skill works across platforms. **Whenever you edit one, propagate the change to every place it is mirrored —
in the same commit.** Nothing here is allowed to drift.

### 1. `SKILL.md` lives at the repo root — single canonical copy

- `SKILL.md` (repo root) — **canonical**. The repo itself is the skill folder: copy or symlink the whole
  repository into `~/.claude/skills/to-logic/`, `~/.cursor/skills/to-logic/`, etc.
- Bundled assets (`references/`, `docs/`, `source/`) live next to it and are referenced by relative path.
- The skill text and its `references/` are **in Russian** (terminology per Chelpanov); keep new material
  in Russian too.

### 2. `version` must match in every manifest

When you bump the version, update it in **all** of these:

- `SKILL.md` frontmatter (repo root).
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
- `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`
- `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`

Then mirror the new number into the `rpa-skills` catalog - see section 4.

### 3. `description` must stay consistent across manifests

The `description` in `SKILL.md` is Russian (it drives auto-triggering for Russian users); the three
plugin manifests share one consistent English description (plus a shorter `interface.shortDescription`
in the Codex manifest). Keep the meaning in step when either changes.

Quick check that the version is identical everywhere:

```bash
grep -RhoE '"version"\s*:\s*"[^"]+"' .claude-plugin .cursor-plugin .codex-plugin | sort -u
```

## `SKILL.md` frontmatter

```yaml
---
name: to-logic
version: <semver>          # major.minor.patch
description: >
  When to use this skill and the triggers that should load it. Be specific — the agent uses this text
  to auto-select the skill.
---
```

- `name` **must** equal the directory name `to-logic` and the slash command (`/to-logic`).
- Bump `version` on every substantive change and keep bundled manifests aligned.

## README.md

Human-facing overview: purpose, when to use, usage examples, and installation. Keep it in step with `SKILL.md`.

## If the skill ships code

Put scripts under `scripts/` at the repo root. Add tests where it makes sense and make sure they pass
before committing.

## Commit checklist

- [ ] `SKILL.md` edited where needed (Russian, terminology per Chelpanov).
- [ ] `version` bumped and identical in `SKILL.md`, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`,
      `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`, `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`.
- [ ] `description` consistent across all manifests (and `interface.shortDescription` in Codex).
- [ ] README updated.
- [ ] Conventional commit message, e.g. `feat(to-logic): …` / `fix(to-logic): …`.
