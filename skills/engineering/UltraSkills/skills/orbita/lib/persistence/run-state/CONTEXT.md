# Run-state persistence context

`persistence/run-state/**` owns the split-file durable run-state aggregate: paths, locks, atomic writes, durable commits, and persisted-state schema.

Binding rules:

- No compatibility facades outside this folder are approved for run-state read/write.
- API and CLI callers import `PersistedRunStateReader.mjs`, `PersistedRunStateWriter.mjs`, `paths.mjs`, and `lock.mjs` directly.
- This folder must not import DTOs or runtime use-cases. Projection belongs at the entrypoint/use-case boundary.
- A persisted-state snapshot is a validated command-local record, not a cache.
  Snapshot reuse is allowed only when the reader captured it inside the same
  active per-run lock scope; the writer returns the replacement snapshot after
  each durable write. Snapshots and their baton/state graph are deeply frozen.
  When the same-scope transaction completes, the returned snapshot and rollback
  bytes are derived from the validated transition without rereading the full
  aggregate. A pending commit supersedes the caller snapshot. Direct
  writes outside the aggregate writer, including append-only history entries,
  invalidate the snapshot before any later aggregate update.
- Snapshot reuse must never weaken pre-lock or under-lock authority checks,
  recovery, rollback, fsync, atomic rename, schema validation, or path/symlink
  safety. Snapshot lock tokens and exact rollback target bytes are process-local
  metadata and must never be serialized into run state. Recovery may reuse those
  bytes only for the same in-scope snapshot. A v2 history transaction may use
  its persisted base existence and byte size for rollback because append never
  changes the base prefix; other rollback targets must be reread when no scoped
  snapshot is available.
- `.workflow-runner/authority.json` is the canonical per-run record for absolute
  workflow binding, private claim context, lifecycle/task projection, and
  token-hash lease authority. Raw lease tokens, run-state snapshots, prompts,
  and host/session metadata must never be written to it.
- Runner commands must validate authority before waiting on the per-run lock and
  re-read/revalidate it while holding that lock. Successful renewal writes only
  the per-run record atomically. Matching-token renewal preserves `tokenEpoch`;
  an explicit tokenless takeover of a stale or occupied lease increments it
  while rotating the token hash.
- `runs.json` is a discovery and list/dashboard projection. Once a valid per-run
  authority file exists, runner binding, claim context, lease checks, status,
  and task metadata must not trust a conflicting catalog copy. Warm runner
  commands must not read, lock, or rewrite the catalog. Catalog list/dashboard
  readers overlay per-run authority with bounded concurrency.
- A legacy v1 catalog entry may supply authority only while the per-run file is
  absent. The first successful mutating runner or claim operation persists the
  canonical record. A present but corrupt, mismatched, or symlinked authority
  file fails closed and must never trigger legacy fallback.
- New durable commits use append transaction v2. The pending record stores one
  transaction id, `baseExists`, `baseSize`, bounded `entryText`, its SHA-256
  hash, and requested baton/current-request values. It must not contain the full
  existing history. The transaction id is also written into the human-facing
  history entry.
- V2 recovery is byte-oriented and idempotent. The history file may be exactly
  at the recorded base, contain an exact partial prefix of `entryText`, or
  contain the full entry. Recovery truncates only the partial transaction tail,
  writes the complete entry at `baseSize`, fsyncs it, then applies the remaining
  durable targets. Any unrelated tail, file shorter than the base, oversized
  append, hash mismatch, unsafe path, or symlink fails closed. A complete entry
  is never appended twice. Legacy v1 full-history pending records remain
  recoverable but are not emitted by new writes.
- Baton-only command paths retain `{ mode: 'file-ref', path }` plus process-local
  history byte size and do not read the history body. Full history reads are
  allowed only for consumers whose behavior depends on history content, such as
  pointer projection/mutation, dashboard projection, and orchestrator debug-note
  deduplication. Neither form is cached across commands.
- New `current-requests.json` records bind requests to the post-commit baton
  file signature (absolute path, device/inode, mtime/ctime, and byte size), computed after the baton
  side effect during recovery. This avoids reserializing a large unchanged baton
  only to hash it. Legacy 64-hex semantic hashes remain readable until the next
  successful write refreshes the record. Workflow file signatures keep the same
  file-signature contract.
- An unchanged baton is parsed and schema-validated once per command and is not
  reserialized merely to bind current requests. A changed baton remains one
  canonical atomic JSON file, so clone/serialization/fsync cost is necessarily
  linear in its size. Segmenting baton state is outside this persistence slice.
- Durable workflow state is baton plus history; per-run authority is separate
  durable control-plane state. Current host responses, request lists, and
  compiled prompts are projections of baton plus the authority-bound workflow.
- API `next`, `continue`, `write-output`, and `instructions` read persisted baton before rendering; `continue` and `write-output` validate accepted outputs against the freshly rendered current requests, and `instructions` returns the freshly rendered prompt for the current step.
- Pointer recovery API functions `listPointerTransitions` and `movePointer` use
  CLI modes `list-pointer-transitions` and `move-pointer`. They read persisted
  baton through this run-state boundary; debug history is not a navigation
  source. Both require active
  lease authority. `listPointerTransitions` is a logical read: it may use the
  run-state boundary for consistency, but it must not initialize missing run
  state, append history, renew authority, or mutate baton/current pointer
  state. `movePointer` must use the existing lease, lock, recover, validate,
  durable writer, history append, and per-run authority renewal path; it may change only
  baton cursor/status plus persistence metadata owned by that path.
- Pointer recovery must never edit private run files directly or use an
  alternate manual state writer. It must not roll back, prune, rewrite, or clean
  `baton.state`, accepted outputs, artifacts/results, worker bindings, prompt
  markers, attempts, or existing history content.
- `history.md` is the managed, deterministic, human-facing flight recorder for one run. It records lifecycle/control-flow history, accepted-output summaries, required bounded worker debug-summary side-channel content, terminal outcomes, and safe public failures; it is not a transcript store.
- `write-output` owns accepted-output history entries after output schema validation, artifact path validation, and worker debug-summary side-channel validation. For `run_worker`, accepted-output projection requires the exact generated `--debug-summary-file` path, validates a non-empty regular file, and reads only a bounded prefix; the debug summary is not part of baton/state. Rich debug-summary body ingestion is suppressible and is bounded after normalization to 4 KiB or 80 lines with a truncation marker.
- `continue` owns transition and terminal history, and those history writes must stay atomic with baton transition durability. Retry/recovery must not duplicate, corrupt, or advance misleading history entries ahead of baton state.
- `movePointer` owns pointer-recovery history entries. They must be append-only
  and atomic with the cursor/status update, recording bounded before/after
  cursor/status edge, transition id, direction, and state-preservation fact.
  Existing history is never rewritten by pointer recovery.
- Public command failure history may be appended only when a safe run directory, matching lease context, and managed history path are available. Record only exact relevant public error text after host-safe redaction, bounded after normalization to 2 KiB or 40 lines with a truncation marker. Unsafe or missing context means no history write.
- History must never scrape or persist hidden host transcripts, session registries, private prompts, lease tokens, instruction storage paths, worker lifecycle state, or other host control-plane metadata.
