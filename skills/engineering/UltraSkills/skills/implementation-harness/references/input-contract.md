# Input Contract

Required input:

- Approved task context:
  - goal
  - non-goals
  - acceptance criteria
  - repo identifier or path context
  - issue URL if one exists
- Approved `reasons-canvas-research`:
  - closed proposal / approved direction
  - facts
  - evidence
  - risks
  - unresolved blockers status
  - design-test need when relevant
- Approved execution-plan packet:
  - approved file zones or feature slice
  - implementer owners
  - reviewer plan
  - rollback point
  - docs to update
  - design-test status/scope when relevant
  - sensitive-surface handling when relevant
  - request-path / contract touchpoints when relevant

Optional input:

- preferred branch name
- existing implementation constraints
- prior failed attempt notes
- explicit verification expectations

Input assumptions:

- Approval already happened.
- Research is closed enough to implement from without broad rediscovery.
- Execution planning is closed enough to implement from without re-negotiating ownership or scope.
- When this harness applies, the parent/orchestrator session stays in orchestration mode and delegates implementation to worker/subagent implementers; speed or convenience does not justify manual in-orchestrator implementation.
- Plain user action verbs like `fix`, `do`, `сделай`, or `исправь` do not count as permission for direct parent-session implementation; only an explicit request for direct in-session execution overrides the orchestrator default.
- If required implementer delegation is unavailable, fails to start, or cannot be used, this stage stops as `blocked` instead of falling back to manual parent-session implementation.
- This skill owns development plus verification handoff, not the independent post-implementation review gate.
- Transport layer may have come from GitHub, linear, docs, or chat; this skill stays transport-agnostic.

If approval status is unclear, the execution-plan packet is missing, file ownership is still ambiguous, or an implementation-critical fact is still missing, stop and return `blocked`.

If Architect ran for architecture-sensitive work, block implementation when the handoff lacks any Architect-owned proof/handoff field triggered by the slice: `domain_source_proof_map`, `source_layout_owner_map`, `runtime_path_map`, `schema_domain_ownership_map`, `compatibility_surface_plan`, `deletion_migration_plan`, `forbidden_placements_imports`, `verification_surfaces`, or `reviewer_gates`. Non-triggered fields may be omitted or explicitly marked `not_applicable` / `n/a_with_reason`; do not infer or recreate missing triggered Architect decisions inside implementation.
