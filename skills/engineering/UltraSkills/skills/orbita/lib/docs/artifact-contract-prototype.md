# Artifact contract prototype

This is a narrow contract prototype for DevHarness/research workflows. It centralizes low-level artifact mechanics in schema definitions and renderer-generated field notes while keeping workflow step prompts focused on semantic instructions.

It does not implement a full Artifact Store, promotion model, aliases, revisions, or runtime-managed artifact persistence. The prompt builder remains a dumb renderer: it reads templates/schemas, replaces supported placeholders, appends strict generated sections, and does not choose artifact ids, paths, or workflow behavior.

## Central artifact schema shape

The shared baton schema owns artifact metadata under `./lib/entities/Baton/schema/baton.json#/$defs/artifact`:

```json
{
  "id": "reasons-canvas-research",
  "content_type": "text/markdown",
  "path": "/path/to/run/research_draft/artifacts/reasons-canvas-research.md",
  "summary": "Research Canvas for approval."
}
```

Required fields:

- `id`: artifact id unique within the producer step.
- `content_type`: MIME/content type, for example `text/markdown` or `application/json`.
- `path`: full absolute filesystem path to the generated artifact file. For new worker output validation, the path must be inside the current step artifact output directory: `<run>/<stepId>/artifacts/`.

Optional fields:

- `summary`: compact handoff text.

Not included: `type`, `kind`, `ref`, `producer_step_id`, `version`, `replaces`, `aliases`, promotion, or final/approved artifact semantics.

## Baton state boundary

The canonical read path for artifacts is the producer step output:

```js
baton.state[producerStepId].artifacts[]
```

`baton.state.artifacts` is a strict aggregate of wrapper entries `{ producerStepId, artifact }`. It never accepts flat artifact metadata or extra wrapper fields. Each wrapped `artifact` must still satisfy the same central `{ id, content_type, path, summary? }` schema with no extra fields. Identity is the pair `{ producerStepId, artifact.id }`; the `producerStepId` lives outside the artifact metadata object so producer ownership never leaks into the artifact metadata contract.

The renderer does not choose artifact ids or paths and does not read persisted artifact files. It only renders schema-derived notes from loaded schemas. External schema refs such as the central Baton artifact `$ref` must resolve deterministically; unresolved external refs fail prompt rendering instead of being silently omitted.

## Artifact usage metadata

Artifact field semantics live with the schema using the existing metadata style only:

- `description`: neutral field meaning.
- `x-usage`: producer/reader usage guidance rendered as schema-derived field notes.

This keeps low-level mechanics out of reusable markdown templates and workflow prompts. A producer sees schema-derived fill notes; a reader sees schema-derived usage notes for prompt input values from the same central metadata.

## Prompt separation rule

Workflow step prompts may say semantic things like:

- create the human-facing research Canvas as a markdown artifact;
- attack the prompt input research Canvas artifact as the approval source of truth;
- show the prompt input research Canvas artifact and critic verdict to the user;
- produce architecture decisions from the approved research Canvas.

Workflow step prompts and markdown templates must not repeat low-level mechanics:

- where to write artifact files on disk;
- how to fill the artifact JSON shape;
- where/how to technically read artifact content;
- standard artifact field semantics.

Those mechanics belong in schema definitions and renderer-generated field notes.

## DevHarness end-to-end flow

1. `research_draft` emits `artifacts[0]` for the full human-facing research Canvas, for example:

   ```json
   {
     "id": "reasons-canvas-research",
     "content_type": "text/markdown",
     "path": "/path/to/run/research_draft/artifacts/reasons-canvas-research.md",
     "summary": "Research Canvas for approval."
   }
   ```

2. `research_attack` reads artifact `reasons-canvas-research` from `research_draft` and reviews/attacks that artifact.
3. If attack returns `needs_revision`, `research_draft` projects `research_attack`, revises the Canvas, and emits a fresh artifact for the revised Canvas using the same central schema contract.
4. `approve_research` presents artifact `reasons-canvas-research` from `research_draft` plus `research_attack.verdict` and waits for explicit human approval.
5. On approval, `architecture_draft` uses the approved/current `reasons-canvas-research` artifact from `research_draft` as the research source of truth and produces the minimal architecture decision/structural contract required by that approved research. If architecture work is unnecessary, it records the explicit no-artifact decision in `architecture_contract`.

The JSON output remains authoritative for workflow branching, prompt input context, and gates. The markdown artifact is the human-facing Canvas for review/approval. If the user asks the orchestrator for the research/proposal file, the orchestrator must retrieve or export the existing run artifact referenced by prompt input/output artifacts; it must not ask a worker to recreate the Canvas in an arbitrary temp path.

## Open questions

- Should a later runtime derive local artifact paths from step id and artifact id instead of requiring workers to emit the current absolute `path`?
- Should the runner provide a first-class artifact export helper for host/orchestrator file requests? Current fix keeps this prompt-level: workers and approval prompts must use existing baton/output artifact refs, and no runtime export helper is added here.
- Should the schema eventually enforce the current step artifact directory convention, or should that remain renderer/runtime guidance outside JSON Schema?
